Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Solution:

Method_1:

SELECT DISTINCT STATION.CITY FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(STATION.CITY,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u')
  AND RIGHT(STATION.CITY,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u');

Method_2:

SELECT DISTINCT STATION.CITY FROM STATION
WHERE STATION.CITY REGEXP '^[AEIOUaeiou].*[AEIOUaeiou]$';
